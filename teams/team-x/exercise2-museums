discussed singular vs multiple results for pages
individual high level domains will use ID's as uri
plural will have appended uri's for subdomains and/or parameters

also -- how long should the rest url get and when should we start using parameters?

such as


/exhbit/id/
/exhibits/current/
/exhibits/<historical string>/
the following would be paramaterized
/exhibits/<historical string>/date
/exhibits/<historical string>/location

/location/id/
/locations/

/artist/id/
/artists/
